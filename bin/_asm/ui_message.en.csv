12,"<Face_2><Bal_1>This <turnpl> opponent displays some formidable strengths. It gives me some troubles."
13,"<Face_4><Bal_0>I mind that you feel certain attraction to such character, Tsarevna."
14,"<Face_4><Bal_0>Perhaps Tsarevna could learn from this character and be little more...ladylike."
15,"<Face_5><Bal_0>I hear what you say, Kiryl!"
16,"<Face_0><Bal_1>Hey there, <turnpl>! Let's sweat it out, huh? What do you say?"

24,"<Face_2><Bal_0>I'm afraid I can't get excited about any activity with a sparring partner such as yourself. Outwitting you will be the only pleasure I draw from this."
25,"<Face_1><Bal_0>And my only pleasure is for Goddess to bestow blessing on both you, Angelo, and of course also on <turnpl>."
26,"<Face_2><Bal_0>The only victory I'm looking for is to win the heart of a fair maiden like you, <turnpl>."
27,"<Face_4><Bal_0>When I observate Angelo, I am full with unease that priests are viewed also as such frivolous creatures."

33,"<Face_5><Bal_0>I couldn't prey on the weak. It just isn't my style."
34,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Ain't no con sessions fer ladies round my neck o' the woods! So, er...watch yer back!"
35,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Bad luck. It looks like <turnpl> doesn't want to be bothered with child-minding."
36,"<Face_6><Bal_1>Blimey! That girl's a bit bubbly, eh!?"
37,"<Face_3><Bal_1>What are you trying to say, boy? Stop talking nonsense!"

39,"<Face_3><Bal_1>Whatever's wrong with girls playing games, you silly little boy! Come on, <turnpl>, let's give him a good thrashing!"
40,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Awright then, Smiles, it's ‘fight wisely’, OK? No 'eroics, right. Just make sure <turnpl> don't win."
41,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Yessir, mister Yangus, sir! (slurp) ...But, what are ‘eroics’? Some kind of workout?"

44,"<Face_2><Bal_0>I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to go up against you, <turnpl>. It's so exciting to finally find a decent opponent."
45,"<Face_5><Bal_0>Well, well! A man who gets Jessica hot under the collar... This will be interesting."
46,"<Face_4><Bal_1>Jessica and <turnpl> at the same time! ...Phew! I couldn't choose between them. It wouldn't be fair to deny either of them."
47,"<Face_5><Bal_0>Why doesn't such a comment surprise me? A character like him could never just choose one person to support and stay faithful to them."
48,"<Face_3><Bal_1>I ain't about to lose to no slimeball! And I ain't about to lose to a slime, neither, <turnpl>! Heh heh!"
49,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Eek! You're oozing with more confidence than a metal king slime!"

56,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Now we do battle for victory, <turnpl>! There is no lenience here. You must prepare yourself!"
57,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Um, I say, Miss Alena... You do realize this isn't some kind of fighting tournament, don't you?"

1941,"<Face_3><Bal_1>The reason <turnpl> can't focus is because you keep saying you're gonna make him your minion, Bowser!"
1942,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Sorry, <turnpl>! I'd really love to give you a helping hand, but I just can't lose to Mario! You understand, don't you?"
1943,"<Face_3><Bal_1>Bowser! Don't try to sweet-talk <turnpl>! Everyone knows you're just pretending to be nice so you can kidnap her later!"
1944,"<Face_1><Bal_1>Don't fret, <turnpl>! Sure, you're in last place now... But that doesn't mean you won't finish in first!"
1945,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Mario's right! Keep your chin up, <turnpl>!"

1947,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Mario's right! Keep your chin up, <turnpl>!"
1948,"<Face_1><Bal_1>Keep going, <turnpl>! It's way too early to give up!"
1949,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Hey, Mario—what gives? You seem like you're more concerned about <turnpl> than you are about me!"
1950,"<Face_1><Bal_1>Keep going, <turnpl>! It's way too early to give up!"
1951,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Hey, Mario—what gives? You seem like you're more concerned about <turnpl> than you are about me!"
1952,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Yoshi Yoshi! (You need to eat one of my cookies, <turnpl>! It'll cheer you up!)"
1953,"<Face_2><Bal_0>It's true! Yoshi's cookies will turn your frown upside down!"
1954,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Yoshi Yoshi! (You need to eat one of my cookies, <turnpl>! It'll cheer you up!)"
1955,"<Face_2><Bal_0>It's true! Yoshi's cookies will turn your frown upside down!"
1956,"<Face_2><Bal_1>You know why you're in last place, <turnpl>? 'Cause you haven't eaten any garlic today!"
1957,"<Face_0><Bal_1>Huh? I haven't eaten any garlic either, you know! That's a weird obsession you've got there, Wario..."
1958,"<Face_2><Bal_1>You know why you're in last place, <turnpl>? 'Cause you haven't eaten any garlic today!"

1960,"<Face_1><Bal_1>I know just what it would take to win this game, <turnpl>—a Super Mushroom!"

1964,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Hey, I've got a bright idea, <turnpl>! I'll give you a Super Mushroom! That'll give you the strength to keep on going!"

1976,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Don't worry, <turnpl>—it's not your fault you're in last place. I blame Bowser!"

1978,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Don't worry, <turnpl>—it's not your fault you're in last place. I blame Bowser!"
1979,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Sure, sure—it's MY fault you've got bad business sense! Bwah hah hah!"
1980,"<Face_3><Bal_1>Well, this isn't very exciting! How can we have any fun when <turnpl> is in last place?"
1981,"<Face_3><Bal_0>I know! It's boring for me too. Come on, <turnpl>! What are you waiting for? Make your big move!"

1984,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Oh, you certainly don't deserve to be in last place, <turnpl>! You belong in second place, right after me!"
1985,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Kind and gracious as always, Princess Peach. You should show Her Royal Highness some gratitude, <turnpl>!"

1989,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Ooh! Ooh! Do you want a kiss from me too?"
1990,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Are you letting me win, <turnpl>? That's sweet, but this game would be more fun if you gave me a challenge!"
1991,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Oh, puh-lease! Don't listen to her, <turnpl>! I know you're doing your best!"
1992,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Psst! You want to win, <turnpl>? Give me the rest of your money, and I'll invest it for you! Trust me!"
1993,"<Face_3><Bal_1>Hang on! Don't listen to Wario! You'd be better off giving your money to ME!"
1994,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Psst! You want to win, <turnpl>? Give me the rest of your money, and I'll invest it for you! Trust me!"
1995,"<Face_3><Bal_1>Hang on! Don't listen to Wario! You'd be better off giving your money to ME!"
1996,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Nyah hah! You're not putting up much of a fight, <turnpl>! I could win this game with both hands tied behind my back!"
1997,"<Face_3><Bal_0>Ook! Ooook oooook! (Wario's just trying to psych you out! You can beat him, <turnpl>!)"
1998,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Nyah hah! You're not putting up much of a fight, <turnpl>! I could win this game with both hands tied behind my back!"

2000,"<Face_5><Bal_0>Keep it together, <turnpl>! If you quit, this will all have been a big waste of time! Where's the fun in that?"
2001,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Oookity ook! Ooook! (She's right, <turnpl>! You can't give up now!)"
2002,"<Face_5><Bal_0>Keep it together, <turnpl>! If you quit, this will all have been a big waste of time! Where's the fun in that?"

2004,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Hee hee! Ready to throw in the towel yet, <turnpl>?"
2005,"<Face_3><Bal_1>Don't pay any attention to him, <turnpl>! If you and I work together, we can stomp all over Bowser Jr.!"
2006,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Hee hee! Ready to throw in the towel yet, <turnpl>?"
2007,"<Face_3><Bal_1>Don't pay any attention to him, <turnpl>! If you and I work together, we can stomp all over Bowser Jr.!"
2008,"<Face_3><Bal_1>Hey, <turnpl>! This is turning into a snoozefest! How 'bout you stir things up a little?"
2009,"<Face_2><Bal_1>Bwah hah! Why don't you just crush him and get it over with, Son?"
2010,"<Face_5><Bal_0>Wish I could help you out, <turnpl>! But I can't show any mercy, not even for you!"
2011,"<Face_5><Bal_0>Yeah, don't take pity on her, Dad! She knew what she was signing up for when she turned on this game!"
2012,"<Face_1><Bal_0>Ook! Ook oooookity! (Don't look so worried, <turnpl>! You can still win this game!)"
2013,"<Face_2><Bal_0>Oook ook! Oooook! (And if all else fails, eat a banana! You can do anything with a little banana power!)"

4557,"Mario: The universal hero who dashes and jumps his way around the world. His trademark outfit of a red shirt, overalls, and an “M”-embroidered hat is known to all."
4558,"Luigi: Mario's twin brother. Though normally quiet and unassuming, he's a shrewd and powerful man."
4559,"Peach: Princess of Mushroom Kingdom, often kidnapped by the wicked Bowser. Although she lives a sheltered life, she's not afraid of a battle on Fortune Street!"
4560,"Yoshi: Mario's trusty adventuring partner who carries Mario around on the shell on his back. His long tongue's perfect for slurping up fruit and giving his adversaries a good licking, too!"
4561,"Bowser: Head of the Koopa Troop, whose sole aim seems to be disturbing the peace in Mushroom Kingdom. He's a dangerous business rival, who won't hesitate to buy your property from under you."
4562,"Toad: Never far from Princess Peach's side, Toad is here on Fortune Street too. He's a thoroughly nice Toad who's rooting for everyone!"
4563,"Donkey Kong: A soft-hearted, yet hard as nails hero of the jungle. Is he only here on Fortune Street for the banana-selling fruit stalls!?"
4564,"Wario: A slightly vulgar miscreant who rivals Mario whether he wants it or not. He has no idea of value, but will do anything to make a quick buck!"
4565,"Waluigi: A strange baddie who's fueled solely by the desire to oppose Luigi. His twisted ways are sure to upset everyone!"
4566,"Daisy: The bright and lively, if slightly tomboyish, Princess of Sarasaland. Now she's bringing her bubbling enthusiasm to Fortune Street."
4567,"Birdo: A fluttery-eyed, pouting, pink creature with a very unusual mouth that spews eggs!"
4568,"Diddy Kong: The one and only, long-tailed, red-hatted partner to Donkey Kong. He swings deftly around Fortune Street as if it were his jungle home."
4569,"Bowser Jr.: The mischievous, practical-joking son of Bowser. He's a chip off the old block and definitely not someone to be messed with!"
4570,"Slime: The quintessential quirky character of any Dragon Quest domain. Slimes are podgy and squishy and speak almost perfect “gooman”."
4571,"Princess Princessa: A noble princess dedicated to the restoration of her beloved Moonbrooke after its ruinous fall at the hand of monsterkind. She's here to earn gold to fund the reconstruction work."
4572,"Kiryl: A priest serving in Zamoksva who secretly covets Tsarevna Alena. He remains glued to her side, protecting her from harm with his magical mastery."
4573,"Yangus: A half-inching hoodlum from the sticky-fingered town of Pickham who dreams of becoming a thief among thieves. This is young Yangus, but he's as cor-blimey as ever!"
4574,"Angelo: A Templar Knight from Maella Abbey whose cool character is just as adept at winning over the ladies as winning on Fortune Street."
4575,"Platypunk: A duck-billed, dough-collecting Don's dogsbody. He and his Plob mob once attacked Slimenia, and the wound's still oozing now."
4576,"Bianca: A bit of a tomboy in her youth, Bianca has grown up to be a kind and gentle woman. But she still makes the odd daring move here and there!"
4577,"Alena: A tomboyish Tsarevna from Zamoksva who's snuck out to try her hand at Fortune Street! She's a little too impulsive to make a go of it, though."
4578,"Carver: Don't let this muscle-bound hulk's appearance deceive you. Carver is a gentle and feeling man. But can his carpentry skills build him a fortune on Fortune Street?"
4579,"Jessica: A well-to-do young lady from Alexandria. She's headstrong and bold, and won't give you any quarter whatsoever."
4580,"Dragonlord: The kingpin of monsterkind who would see the world plunged into darkness. True to his dastardly disposition, his shops are powerhouses of impoverishment that lurk around every bend to bring you to your knees."
4581,"Stella: A mysterious female who's all about appearances, devoted to fashion and definitely NOT a faer— She always does the first thing that enters her head, which might just win her the game!"
4582,"Patty: A networking pundit who the lonely adventurer can rely on to be behind the counter of her Party Planning Place whenever needed. When it comes to running a business, is there anyone better?"

5136,"What are the <dq>standard rules<dq>? The well-loved rules played by fans of the series since 1991. Dabble in stocks and dominate districts in a deeply devious game of commercial deftness!"
5137,"What are the <dq>easy rules<dq>? A simpler version of the game that absolutely anyone can enjoy. Buy shops, build them up, and bring it home in a bold, brisk game of business and bargaining!"
5138,"Aim to freeload! If you spot a competitor making a move that's likely to push up a district's stock prices, jump on the bandwagon and buy those stocks! This is an advanced business technique Fortune Streeters call “freeloading”!"
5139,"Use your inside knowledge! By investing capital into districts in which you own stock, you can make a profit from the stock price rise that follows. It's the fundamental way to make your stocks work for you. A shameless technique known as <dq>insider trading<dq>!"
5140,"Sidestep the stock price slide! If you sell ten or more of a district's stocks at any one time, the stock price will fall. Try to ensure you only ever sell a maximum of nine stocks in an area, and you'll steer clear of the crash!"
5141,"Slow those tycoons down! If you own stocks in the same district as one of your competitors, you can give their assets a knock by selling stocks in tens. Just be careful that you don't lose out more than the competition!"
5142,"Dig those dividends! Whenever a sale is made in districts in which you own stock, you receive a dividend. The dividend amount is divided up among the stock owners in proportion to how much each owns."
5143,"Keep buyouts at bay! Low-value shops are in real danger of being forcibly bought out. To avoid a buyout, invest capital in such shops as quickly as possible and up their value."
5144,"Forced buyout fees. If one of your shops is bought out from under you for five times its value, you'll sadly only see three times its value filling up your purse. The rest goes to the bank as an <dq>administration fee<dq>!"
5145,"Avail yourself of auctions! If you run out of ready cash and have no stocks, the bank will repossess property from you to cover your dues. But only at 75% of its value! So if you think you're about to hit the breadline, best to auction a shop before you roll the die."
