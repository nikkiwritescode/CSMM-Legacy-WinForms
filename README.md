# About CSMM
This version of CSMM has been depreciated -- you should generally use the new, [cross-platform CSMM-qt](https://github.com/FortuneStreetModding/csmm-qt) for most things these days.

## App description
CSMM is designed to facilitate the modding of Fortune Street (NTSC) or Boom Street (PAL). It allows easy bulk swapping of custom maps, and includes options to patch the game to Wiimmfi and apply Deflaktor's ASM Hacks.

Please refer to HowTo.docx for further information on operating the program.

The original version of this program was released on March 22, 2020.
